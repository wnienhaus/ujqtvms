# ujqtvms

A simple project to test publising to pypi using Github Actions, when
creating a Release using Github.

(The name ujqtvms was chosen at random in attempt to find something
that wouldn't ever be used - thus not cluttering up pypi's namespace,
given that modules by a given name can only ever be created once)
